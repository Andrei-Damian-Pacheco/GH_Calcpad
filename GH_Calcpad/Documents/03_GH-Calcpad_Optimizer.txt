GH_CALCPAD_OPTIMIZER - REVOLUTIONARY OPTIMIZATION COMPONENT
===========================================================

1. OBJECTIVE:
============
Create an innovative component that automatically converts any CPD file into an optimizable objective function for optimization algorithms (Galapagos, Octopus, Genetic Algorithms). This eliminates manual setup and provides intelligent auto-detection of design variables and objectives.

2. CORE INNOVATION:
==================
Unlike traditional plugins that require extensive manual configuration, GH_Calcpad_Optimizer provides:
- AUTO-DETECTION of design variables and objectives using AI analysis
- INTELLIGENT CACHING to avoid redundant calculations (5-10x speed improvement)
- MULTI-OBJECTIVE optimization with automatic weighting
- CONVERGENCE ANALYSIS with real-time progress monitoring
- ZERO-CONFIGURATION workflow for typical optimization scenarios

3. TRADITIONAL WORKFLOW vs REVOLUTIONARY WORKFLOW:
=================================================

TRADITIONAL METHOD (other plugins):
----------------------------------
1. User loads CPD file manually
2. User manually identifies which variables to optimize
3. User manually configures ranges and constraints  
4. User individually connects each variable to optimization sliders
5. User manually defines objective function
6. Each evaluation recalculates everything from scratch (slow)
7. Only optimizes 1 objective at a time
8. Setup time: 30+ minutes for complex cases

REVOLUTIONARY METHOD (GH_Calcpad_Optimizer):
--------------------------------------------
1. Connect CPD → Optimizer component automatically analyzes file
2. Auto-detects candidate design variables using intelligent patterns
3. Auto-detects optimization objectives from calculation results
4. Single connection to Galapagos/Octopus
5. Intelligent cache prevents redundant calculations
6. Simultaneous multi-objective optimization
7. Real-time convergence analysis and suggestions
8. Setup time: 30 seconds (connect and optimize)

4. COMPONENT ARCHITECTURE:
=========================

-------
- Sheet Object: CalcpadSheet from Load CPD
- Design Variables: List of variables to optimize (auto-detected if empty)
- Variable Values: Current values from optimizer (Galapagos input)
- Objective Names: Variables to minimize/maximize (auto-detected if empty)
- Optimization Mode: minimize/maximize/target per objective
- Target Values: Target values for 'target' mode (optional)

OUTPUTS:
--------

- Objective Values: Individual values for each objective
- Status: Calculation status and convergence information
- Iteration: Current iteration number
- Best Fitness: Best fitness found so far
- Suggested Variables: Auto-detected variables for optimization
- Convergence Info: Progress analysis and recommendations

5. AUTO-DETECTION ALGORITHMS:
============================

DESIGN VARIABLES AUTO-DETECTION:
--------------------------------
Strategy 1 - Round Values Analysis:
- Identifies variables with "round" values (10, 50, 100, 500, etc.)
- Round values typically indicate user-set parameters vs calculated results
- Example: beam_height = 300mm (likely design parameter)

Strategy 2 - Unit Pattern Analysis:
- Analyzes units for typical design dimensions
- Target units: mm, m, cm, kN, MPa, kg, °, rad
- Variables with these units are design candidates
- Example: material_strength = 250MPa (design parameter)

Strategy 3 - Variable Name Analysis:
- Searches for keywords indicating design variables
- Keywords: width, height, thickness, diameter, length, angle
- Example: column_diameter = 500mm (design parameter)

Strategy 4 - Position Analysis:
- Variables defined early in CPD are typically inputs
- Variables calculated later are typically results
- Prioritizes early-defined variables as design candidates

OBJECTIVE AUTO-DETECTION:
-------------------------
Strategy 1 - Keyword Analysis:
- Searches for result-indicating keywords in variable names
- Keywords: stress, weight, cost, area, volume, force, moment, deflection
- Example: max_stress, total_weight, construction_cost

Strategy 2 - Calculation Pattern Analysis:
- Identifies variables that are results of complex calculations
- Variables appearing in equations with multiple operations
- Example: safety_factor = material_strength / max_stress

Strategy 3 - Final Results Analysis:
- Variables calculated at the end of CPD file
- Typically represent final design verification results
- Last 10-20% of variables in calculation sequence

Strategy 4 - Unit-Based Objective Detection:
- Stress units (MPa, kN/m²) → minimize stress
- Weight units (kg, kN) → minimize weight  
- Cost units (currency) → minimize cost
- Deflection units (mm, m) → minimize deflection

6. INTELLIGENT CACHING SYSTEM:
==============================

CACHE KEY GENERATION:
--------------------
- Creates unique hash from variable values combination
- Example: [300, 50, 250] → "300_50_250_hash"
- Only recalculates if exact combination hasn't been evaluated

CACHE STRATEGIES:
----------------
Strategy 1 - Exact Match Cache:
- Stores results for exact variable combinations
- Perfect for repeated evaluations in optimization

Strategy 2 - Tolerance-Based Cache:
- Considers values within tolerance as "same"
- Useful for continuous optimization algorithms
- Example: 300.001 ≈ 300.000 (within 0.1% tolerance)

Strategy 3 - Interpolation Cache:
- Estimates results between cached points
- Advanced feature for ultra-fast approximations
- Uses linear/polynomial interpolation

CACHE PERFORMANCE:
-----------------
- Traditional: 1000 evaluations = 1000 CPD calculations
- With Cache: 1000 evaluations = ~200 unique calculations
- Speed improvement: 5-10x faster optimization
- Memory efficient: Stores only unique combinations

7. MULTI-OBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION:
================================

OBJECTIVE COMBINATION METHODS:
-----------------------------
Method 1 - Weighted Sum:
- fitness = w1*obj1 + w2*obj2 + w3*obj3
- Automatic weight assignment based on objective magnitude
- User can override weights via input

Method 2 - Normalization:
- Normalizes each objective to [0,1] range
- Prevents dominance by large-magnitude objectives
- Example: stress/max_stress + weight/max_weight

Method 3 - Target-Based:
- Minimizes distance to target values
- fitness = |obj1-target1| + |obj2-target2|
- Useful for design specification compliance

OPTIMIZATION MODES:
------------------
- MINIMIZE: fitness = objective_value
- MAXIMIZE: fitness = -objective_value  
- TARGET: fitness = |objective_value - target|
- CONSTRAINT: penalty if outside bounds

8. CONVERGENCE ANALYSIS:
=======================

CONVERGENCE METRICS:
-------------------
- Best fitness trend over iterations
- Rate of improvement detection
- Stagnation detection (no improvement in N iterations)
- Diversity analysis (spread of solutions)

AUTOMATIC SUGGESTIONS:
---------------------
- "Optimization converged" - stop condition reached
- "Increase population size" - insufficient diversity
- "Adjust variable ranges" - hitting boundaries
- "Add more iterations" - still improving
- "Check objectives" - unrealistic targets detected

REAL-TIME FEEDBACK:
------------------
- Current vs best fitness comparison
- Improvement rate percentage
- Estimated iterations to convergence
- Optimization efficiency metrics
